# What is Machine Learning?

What if I asked you to write code to label images on whether it is an apple or an orange? You could start by making rule-based assumptions about each of these fruits, but there would always be an exception to the rule.
Machine Learning is the study of algorithms that learn from examples and experience instead of relying on hard-coded rules.

# Prerequisites
1. Open up Jupyter Notebooks and hit “Try Jupyter with Python”
2. Wait for it to start the server and open up a jupyter notebook
3. Create on File New to open a new python notebook(.pynb)
4. Then, import sklearn
5. And, hit run!
